<h3>Hi, I’m @W4D30W3NW4775,</h3>

<p>i'am new on github and i think this is a good place to share my coding projects.</p>

<p>i'm also new to coding, so don't expect any 1000000000 line projects...:). currently<br>
  i'm writing smaller projects (mainly in python at the moment) and i'am very happy<br>
when they works.</p>


<p>i am grateful for any constructive criticism...:)</p>
